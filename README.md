## Description

This repository contains the code for the API and client side of a web application built using Express.js/Node.js, MongoDB, and React. The repository is structured into two main folders: `api` and `client`.

The `api` folder contains the server-side code responsible for handling requests, interacting with the database, and serving data to the client. It is built using Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js, and utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing and retrieving data.

The `client` folder contains the client-side code written in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It focuses on the user interface components and handles the interactions with the server-side API endpoints.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project locally, follow the instructions below:

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18.15.0 or higher)
- MongoDB (version 6.0.6 or higher)

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
cd repository
```
## API Setup

To set up the API server, follow the instructions below:


## Navigate to the api folder
```bash
cd api
```
## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Set up the environment variables:
- Create a .env file based on the .env.example template provided
- Update the necessary environment variables with your own configuration

## Start the API server
```bash
npm start
```

The API server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

## Navigate to the client folder
```bash
cd client
```
## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
## Set up the environment variables:
- Create a .env file based on the .env.example template provided
 - Update the necessary environment variables with your own configuration

## Start the client development server
```bash
npm start
```

The React development server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
Once the installation and setup steps are complete, you can use the web application by accessing http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

The application consists of a user interface built with React, allowing users to interact with the API endpoints provided by the Express.js server in the api folder. The server communicates with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data.
