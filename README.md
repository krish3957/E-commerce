**Description**
This repository contains the code for the API and client side of a web application built using Express.js/Node.js, MongoDB, and React. The repository is structured into two main folders: api and client.

The **`api`** folder contains the server-side code responsible for handling requests, interacting with the database, and serving data to the client. It is built using Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js, and utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing and retrieving data.

The **`client`** folder contains the client-side code written in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It focuses on the user interface components and handles the interactions with the server-side API endpoints.
